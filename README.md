## Test with a Cocos Creator project:

Challenge made with the base project https://bitbucket.org/inogames/tests/downloads/

The proposed requirements have been met. To check, simply run the game and test it a few times to see the pattern recognition and the glow animations on the lines.

Some functions were created in the GameManager class and a new class was created called Glow.ts in the Scripts folder.
